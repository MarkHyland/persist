To play a game of tic tac toe: 


$ ruby play.rb


After the names are taken, the stats of the players will be displayed in a string. 

Tests check to see that when a player wins, loses, or ties, that it adds to their stats.

I used the instructor's version of tic-tac-toe game. This is because his version was
slightly cleaner, especially in regards to his tracking of players in the Player class.
His game is showed in the normal.rb and play.rb files.  Where I made changes to his
code, I added in comments.
